2\. If you want to send personal notifications, you need to obtain chat ID of the user the bot should send messages to.

Send "/getid" to "@myidbot" in Telegram messenger.

Ask the user to send "/start" to the bot, created in step 1. If you skip this step, Telegram bot won't be able to send messages to the user.

3\.If you want to send group notifications, you need to obtain group ID of the group the bot should send messages to. To do so:

Add "@myidbot" and "@your_bot_name_here" to your group.
Send "/getgroupid@myidbot" message in the group.
In the group chat send "/start@your_bot_name_here". If you skip this step, Telegram bot won't be able to send messages to the group.

In the `ParseMode` parameter set required option according to the Telegram's documentation. 
Read the Telegram Bot API documentation to learn how to format action notification messages: [Markdown](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#markdown-style) / [HTML](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#html-style) / [MarkdownV2](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#markdownv2-style).
Note: in this case, your Telegram-related actions should be separated from other notification actions (for example, SMS), otherwise you may get plain text alert with raw Markdown/HTML tags.

Test the media type using chat ID or group ID you've got.

With Pushover, a user can be notified the most convenient way — with push notification straight to a mobile device.

## Pushover setup

Register the account at https://pushover.net/ and then install Pushover app at your iOS or Android device.

Then [click here](https://pushover.net/apps/clone/zabbix) to create new integration with Zabbix.

At this point, we have **Application API Token (token)** of the Zabbix application and **Pushover User Key**.

You would need both in Zabbix pushover webhook.

## Zabbix setup

### Set {$ZABBIX.URL} global macro

Go to Administration->General (Macro) and create new macro that points to your Zabbix frontend

`{$ZABBIX.URL}` = <https://myzabbix.local>

### Setup Pushover media type

Proceed to Administration→ Media types at the Zabbix frontend and find Pushover. If you don't have it, import it from the official Zabbix repository here:

https://git.zabbix.com/projects/ZBX/repos/zabbix/browse/templates/media/pushover

Edit Pushover media type parameters and replace token with your Pushover application key.

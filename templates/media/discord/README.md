# Discord webhook

This guide describes how to integrate your Zabbix 4.4 installation with Discord using the Zabbix webhook feature. This guide will provide instructions on setting up a media type, a user and an action in Zabbix.

## Setting up Discord Webhook

1\. Go to https://discordapp.com/app or open Discord Desktop application. Select your server and channel where you want to get Zabbix notifications.

2\. Press **Edit channel**, select **Webhooks** tab and press **Create Webhook** button

## Setting up Zabbix Webhook
1\. Before setting up Discord Webhook, you need to setup the global macro "{$ZABBIX.URL}", which must contain the URL to the Zabbix frontend.
<br>The URL should be either an IP address, a fully qualified domain name or localhost. Specifying a protocol is mandatory, whereas port is optional.
Good examples:<br>
http://zabbix.com<br>
https://zabbix.lan/<br>
http://localhost<br>
http://127.0.0.1:8080<br>

Bad examples:<br>
zabbix.com<br>
http://zabbix/<br>

2\. In the "Administration > Media types" section, import the [media_discord.xml](media_discord.xml)

3\. If you want to change values of default parameters, open the newly added **Discord** media type.<br>
You can also choose between two notification modes by modifying _"use_default_message"_ parameter value:
- **false** (default)
    - receive problem notifications with predefined set of fields (problem, host name, event severity, event type, etc.)
- **true**
    - receive default message defined in the Zabbix Action that triggered notification

4\. To receive notifications in Discord, you need to create a **Zabbix user** and add **Media** with the **Discord** media type.
The "Send to" field must contain Discord webhook URL created before.
<br>Also donâ€™t forget that in order to send notifications, this user must have access to hosts that generated such problems
